- **npm**: Version 9.x or higher (comes with Node.js)
- **Git**: For version control

### API Credentials (Optional but Recommended)

To use the full functionality, you'll need:

1. **Jira API Access**:
   - Jira domain (e.g., `yourcompany.atlassian.net`)
   - Email address associated with your Jira account
   - API token (generate from [Atlassian API tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens))
   - Project key

2. **Asana API Access**:
   - Personal Access Token (generate from [Asana Developer Console](https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps))
   - Project ID

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lavansh1306/NEW_Velocity_AI.git
cd NEW_Velocity_AI
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following configuration:

```bash
# Jira API credentials
JIRA_DOMAIN=yourcompany.atlassian.net
JIRA_EMAIL=your-email@company.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your_jira_api_token
JIRA_PROJECT_KEY=YOUR_PROJECT_KEY

# Optional: custom field for team names (e.g., customfield_12345)
JIRA_TEAM_FIELD_ID=

# Asana API credentials
ASANA_TOKEN=your_asana_personal_access_token
ASANA_PROJECT_ID=your_asana_project_id

# Server port (defaults to 4000)
API_PORT=4000
```

**Note**: The application will work without API credentials, but integration features will be limited. See warnings in the console for missing configurations.

### 4. Start the Development Server

#### Frontend (React App)
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

#### Backend API Server (Optional)
In a separate terminal:

```bash
npm run api
```

The API server will run on `http://localhost:4000`.

### 5. Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `dist/` directory.

### 6. Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

      "due": "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z",
      "duration": 14
    }
  ]
}
```

## 💻 Development Workflow

### Code Style

- Follow the ESLint configuration (run `npm run lint`)
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices and hooks rules

### Adding New Features

1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Implement your feature in the appropriate directory
3. Test locally with `npm run dev`
4. Run linter: `npm run lint`
5. Build to verify: `npm run build`
6. Commit changes with clear messages
7. Create a pull request

### Testing

While the project doesn't include a formal test suite yet, manual testing is recommended:

1. Test all routes and navigation
2. Verify API integrations with real credentials
3. Check responsive design on multiple screen sizes
4. Test form validations and error handling

## 🚀 Deployment

### Deploying to Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub**: Ensure your code is pushed to a GitHub repository

2. **Connect to Vercel**:
   - Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard

3. **Environment Variables**: Add all variables from `.env` to Vercel's environment settings

4. **Deploy**: Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application

5. **Automatic Deployments**: Push to `main` branch triggers automatic deployments

### Alternative: Deploying to Netlify

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy the dist folder to Netlify
# Use Netlify CLI or drag-and-drop the dist folder
```

### Alternative: Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Update `vite.config.ts` with base URL:
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/NEW_Velocity_AI/',
  // ... other config
})
```

2. Build and deploy:
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy dist folder to gh-pages branch
```

### Self-Hosting

Deploy to any static hosting provider:

1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Serve the `dist/` directory
3. Configure your web server to route all requests to `index.html` (SPA mode)

Example Nginx configuration:
```nginx
location / {
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` file to version control
- **API Tokens**: Rotate API tokens regularly
- **CORS**: Configure CORS appropriately for production
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for API endpoints
- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication for production use
- **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production

## 📊 Data Pipeline

The application uses a sophisticated data pipeline:

1. **Ingestion**: Data pulled from Jira/Asana APIs
2. **Normalization**: Events mapped to canonical format
3. **Processing**: Metrics calculated from normalized events
4. **Storage**: Data cached for performance
5. **Visualization**: Rendered in dashboards and charts

See [docs/data-pipeline.md](./docs/data-pipeline.md) for detailed information.

## 📝 Key Metrics Explained

- **Automation Coverage**: Percentage of work executed automatically vs. manually
- **Human Hours Saved**: Calculated from automation events × average manual time
- **Cost Savings**: Hours saved × hourly rate (configurable)
- **Automation Growth**: Trend analysis of automation adoption over time
- **Capacity Forecasting**: Predicted future capacity based on current trends

See [docs/metrics-and-architecture.md](./docs/metrics-and-architecture.md) for formulas and implementation details.
